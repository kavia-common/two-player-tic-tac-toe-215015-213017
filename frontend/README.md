## Run locally

This template does not include a dev server script. If your environment provides an index.html and bundler, ensure the app mounts to an element with `id="root"` and imports `src/main.tsx`.

Typical steps:
1. npm install
2. Ensure your host app or bundler points to `src/main.tsx`.

## Tech

- React 18
- TypeScript 5
- ESLint 9 / Prettier 3
